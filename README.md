# Flow Shop Scheduling
[Job shop scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job-shop_scheduling) (JSS) is an optimization problem with the goal of scheduling, on a number of machines, jobs with diverse orderings of processing on the machines. The objective is to minimize the schedule length, also called "makespan," or completion time of the last task of all jobs. [Flow shop scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-shop_scheduling) (FSS) is a constrained case of JSS where every job uses every machine in the same order. The machines in FSS problems can often be seen as sequential operations to be executed on each job, as is the case in this particular demo.

![Demo Screenshot](_static/screenshot.png)

This example demonstrates three ways of formulating and optimizing FSS:

*    Formulating a
     [nonlinear model](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/concepts/nl_model.html)
     and solving on a Leap hybrid nonlinear-model solver
*    Formulating a
     [constrained quadratic model](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/concepts/cqm.html)
     (CQM) and solving on a Leap hybrid CQM solver
*    Formulating a mixed-integer problem and solving on a classical mixed-integer linear solver

This example lets you run the scheduler from either the command line or a visual interface built with [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/).

## Usage
Your development environment should be configured to
[access Leapâ€™s Solvers](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/overview/sapi.html).
You can see information about supported IDEs and authorizing access to your
Leap account [here](https://docs.dwavesys.com/docs/latest/doc_leap_dev_env.html).

To run the flow shop demo with the visual interface, from the command line enter

    python app.py

Access the user interface with your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8050/.

To run the flow shop scheduler without the Dash interface, from the command line enter

    python job_shop_scheduler.py [-h] [-i INSTANCE] [-tl TIME_LIMIT] [-os OUTPUT_SOLUTION] [-op OUTPUT_PLOT] [-m] [-v] [-q] [-p PROFILE] [-mm MAX_MAKESPAN]

This calls the FSS algorithm for the input file. Command line arguments are as follows:
- -h (or --help): show this help message and exit
- -i (--instance): path to the input instance file (default: input/tai20_5.txt); see `app_configs.py` for instance names
- -tl (--time_limit) time limit in seconds (default: None)
- -os (--output_solution): path to the output solution file (default: output/solution.txt)
- -op (--output_plot): path to the output plot file (default: output/schedule.png)
- -m (--use_scipy_solver): use SciPy's HiGHS solver instead of the CQM solver (default: True)
- -m (--use_nl_solver): use the nonlinear-model solver instead of the CQM solver (default: False)
- -v (--verbose): print verbose output (default: True)
- -p (--profile): profile variable to pass to the sampler (default: None)
- -mm (--max_makespan): manually set an upper-bound on the schedule length instead of auto-calculating (default: None)

### Problem Instances

Several problem instances are pre-populated under the `input` folder. Some of these instances are contained within the `flowshop1.txt` file, retrieved from the [OR-Library], and parsed when the demo is initialized. These can be accessed as if they were files in the `input` folder, named according to the instance short names in `flowshop1.txt` (e.g., "car2", "reC13"), without filename endings. Other instances were pulled from [E. Taillard's list] of benchmarking instances. If the string "tai" is in the filename, the model expects the format used by Taillard.

## Model and Code Overview

### Problem Parameters

These are the parameters of the problem:

- `n`: the number of jobs
- `m`: the number of machines
- `J`: set of jobs (`{0,1,2,...,n-1}`)
- `M`: set of machines (`{0,1,2,...,m-1}`)
- `T`: set of tasks (`{0,1,2,...,m-1}`) that has same dimension as `M`
- `M_(j,t)`:  the machine that processes task `t` of job `j`
- `T_(j,i)`: the task that is processed by machine `i` for job `j`
- `D_(j,t)`:  the processing duration that task `t` needs for job `j`
- `V`:  maximum possible makespan

### Variables

- `w`: a positive integer variable that defines the completion time (makespan)
of the JSS
- `x_(j_i)`: positive integer variables used to model start of each job `j` on
  machine `i`
- `y_(j_k,i)`: binaries which define if job `k` precedes job `j` on machine `i`

### Objective

The objective is to minimize the makespan (`w`) of the given FSS problem.

### Nonlinear Model

The nonlinear model represents the problem using only the job order for the machines. This is
sufficient to construct feasible, compact solutions. In seeking a minimum, the model uses Ocean's
[dwave-optimization](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/docs_optimization/sdk_index.html)
package's ``ListVariable`` to efficiently permutate the order of jobs.

Typically, solver performance strongly depends on the size of the solution space for the modeled
problem: models with smaller spaces of feasible solutions tend to perform better than ones with
larger spaces. A powerful way to reduce the feasible-solutions space is by using variables that act
as implicit constraints, such as the ``ListVariable`` symbol used here, where the order of jobs is a
permutation of values. The ``max`` operation is used to extract the start time for each job, making
sure that there's no overlap between jobs on machines. No other constraints are necessary.

As can be seen in the two example images below, switching the job order can improve the solution
quality, corresponding to a lowering of the completion time, or the makespan, for the FSS problem.

### Constrained Quadratic Model
The constrained quadratic model (CQM) requires adding a set of constraints to ensure that tasks
are executed in order and that no single machine is used by different jobs at the same time.

#### Precedence Constraint

Our first constraint, [equation 1](#eq2), enforces the precedence constraint.
This ensures that all tasks of a job are executed in the given order.

![equation1](_static/eq1.png)          (1)

This constraint ensures that a task for a given job, `j`, on a machine, `M_(j,t)`,
starts when the previous task is finished. As an example, for consecutive
tasks 4 and 5 of job 3 that run on machine 6 and 1, respectively,
assuming that task 4 takes 12 hours to finish, we add this constraint:
`x_3_6 >= x_3_1 + 12`

#### No-Overlap Constraints
Our second constraint, [equation 2](#eq2), ensures that multiple jobs don't use any machine at the same time.
![eq2](_static/eq2.png)          (2)

Usually this constraint is modeled as two disjunctive linear constraints ([Ku et al. 2016](#Ku) and [Manne et al. 1960](#Manne)); however, it is more efficient to model this as a single quadratic inequality constraint. In addition, using this quadratic equation eliminates the need for using the so called `Big M` value to activate or relax constraint (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_M_method).

The proposed quadratic equation fulfills the same behaviour as the linear constraints:

There are two cases:
- if `y_j,k,i = 0` job `j` is processed after job `k`:
  ![equation2_1](_static/eq2_1.png)
- if `y_j,k,i = 1` job `k` is processed after job `j`:
  ![equation2_2](_static/eq2_2.png)
  Since these equations are applied to every pair of jobs, they guarantee that the jobs don't overlap on a machine.

#### Makespan Constraint
In this demonstration, the maximum makespan can be defined by the user or it will be determined using a greedy heuristic. Placing an upper bound on the makespan improves the performance of the D-Wave sampler; however, if the upper bound is too low then the sampler may fail to find a feasible solution.
